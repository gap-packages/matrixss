The following people deserve special thanks, since the package would not
exist without their help.

Alexander Hulpke, <hulpke@math.colostate.edu>
Alexander Anatolievich Ivanov, <a.ivanov@imperial.ac.uk>
Leonard Soicher, <l.h.soicher@qmul.ac.uk>

Also thanks to Jan Snellman, <jans@math.su.se>, for introducing me to
GAP in general.
