Matrix Schreier-Sims Installation instructions
==============================================

The files should be put in a subdirectory "matrixss" to the gap "pkg"
directory.

In GAP, use the "RequirePackage" command to load the package. This
installs a function "MatrixGroupOrder" which computes the order of a
matrix group, using the version of Schreier-Sims that is supplied in
this package.

In the subdirectory "tst" there is a GAP file "test.g" which performs some tests of the package.
