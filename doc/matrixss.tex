\Chapter{Introduction}

This is a manual for the {\matrixss} package, which is a
package for the {\GAP} system for computational group theory. It
contains an implementation of Schreier-Sims algorithm for matrix
groups, including both the standard deterministic and the standard
probabilistic approach. There is also an implementation of the
so-called Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm, which uses coset
enumeration to possibly speed up the process, but this algorithm is
mainly used for verifying the output of the probabilistic algorithm.

No theory about the Schreier-Sims algorithm will be covered in this
manual, since the theory is well-known and covered elsewhere. For
example, the author of the package has written a report about it, see
\cite{baarnhielm04}. Other references are \cite{butler91},
\cite{soicher98} and \cite{seress03}. In this manual, we are instead only
concerned with the actual implementation, and how to use the package
in {\GAP}.

The package can be downloaded from its homepage, which is 
\URL{http://matrixss.sourceforge.net}

The package author can be reached at \Mailto{redstar_@sourceforge.net}.
