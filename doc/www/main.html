<h2>Schreier-Sims algorithm for matrix groups</h2>

<p>This is the homepage of a project aimed at improving the <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/" target="_top">GAP</a> implementation of Schreier-Sims algorithm for matrix groups.</p>

<p>GAP already includes an implementation of this algorithm, but that
one works with permutation groups, and for other groups it first
computes a permutation representation (a faithful action) and then
work with the resulting permutation group. This package provides an
implementation that is restricted to matrix groups, and work with the
matrices directly, and this makes it more efficient in most cases.</p>
