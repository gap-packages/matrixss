<h2>Schreier-Sims algorithm for matrix groups</h2>

<p>This is the homepage of a project aimed at implementing an efficient version of the
Schreier-Sims algorithm for matrix groups. The implementation is being
made in <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a>.</p>

<p>GAP already includes implementations of the algorithm, but those are
for permutation groups. It is possible to use these implementations for matrix groups,
but since matrix groups are "larger" than permutation groups the
algorithms that works for permutation groups are not in general
efficient for matrix groups, and Schreier-Sims algorithm is one example.</p>
