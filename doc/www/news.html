New release with unimportant changes. Release is mainly for syncing the main release files with te Debian package.

<td> 
A somewhat complete manual now
exists, and the code has had some cosmetic updates and more
documentation. The package is now considered to be in beta stage, and
the Debian packages has been somewhat changed.

<td>
The so-called Verify routine by Sims has been implemented, from the
description in Seress book. This seems to be a better strong
generating test than the STCS algorithm, and one can now choose
between them with an Option when using the probabilistic
algorithm. The Verify algorithm is still neither cleaned up nor
optimised in any way, so it is not fast, but it appears to be both
sound and complete.<br>
<br>
The probabilistic algorithm now again uses the GAP function
PseudoRandom to generate random group elements, since further testing
has indicated that this is the fastest method, even though we have to
calculate inverse matrices for the elements returned by this function.

An algorithm highly inspired by the nearly linear time algorithm,
described in Seress book as well as in the 1991 paper by Babai et al,
has been implemented. Some parts of the nearly linear time algorithm
has not yet been implemented though, in particular the "short Schreier
trees". The implementation is still very slow, though, so the fastest
version is still the standard deterministic algorithm.<br>
<br>
Other changes include the use of random subproducts in the
probabilistic algorithm, instead of random elements computed using the
Rattle algorithm. The representation of Schreier trees has been
somewhat augmented, to include the depth of each node, as well as the
height of the tree. There is a possibility to create shallow Schreier
trees, which are guaranteed to have at most logarithmic depth. These
changes are described in Seress book as well as in the above paper,
and are needed in the nearly linear time algorithm.

<td> A rudimentary manual has been
created, and it is both included in the package distribution and available from the package homepage. The code is now more GAP-connected in the sense that the
algorithms are methods of an operation <tt>StabChainMatrixGroup</tt>
and the package installs a method for the <tt>Size</tt> attribute for
finite matrix groups that uses that attribute to compute the order of
a group.

    The Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm has been optimized and the 
    handling of relations has been fixed. Homomorphisms are now only used when 
    needed, and otherwise normal lists are used to map generator matrices to 
    each corresponding free group.<br>
<br>
    The package is now also available as a Debian package, and is advertised on
    freshmeat.net

    The implementation of Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm seems to be
    working now. It is however still very slow, and there are possibly
    some mistakes in the handling of relations, since it appears that the coset
    enumeration never finishes successfully.

Made an implementation of random element generation using the Rattle algorithm
by Leedham-Green, to avoid using GAP:s built-in algorithm (which is Shake). 
This way some inverse matrix calculations are avoided.<br>
<br>
Also included is a not yet finished implementation of 
Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm, which uses coset enumeration to possibly 
decrease the number of Schreier generators that are considered at each level 
of the standard Schreier-Sims algorithm.

<td>
    Implemented a simple (and yet slow) version of the random
    Schreier-Sims algorithm, as first described by Leon. The algorithm
    does not use any verification but takes as input a probability and
    tries to achieve at least this probability of correctness. However,
    since the group elements are probably not taken from a uniform
    distribution (it uses GAP:s PseudoRandom function) there is no
    theoretical guarantee of any probability.<br>
<br>
    The stopping conditions used are simple: when a number of consecutive
    random elements sift to identity the algorithm terminates, and the
    number is calculated from the given probability. If lower and/or upper
    bounds on the group order are known, they are used in the algorithm.

Added more Options to control when some features of the algorthim
are used, sine it seems that, in particular, the tricks of extending
Schreier trees and using alternating actions do not always make things
go faster. Also incorporated some GAP-related improvements due to
Alexander Hulpke, and a selection of an initial store of base points
using a strategy of O'Brien and Murray.

<td>
    Added an Option to flatten the Schreier trees at creation time (make
    them have height 1), so that later only a single hash lookup is needed to
    find the orbit element for a given point.
    The Option is called "SimpleSchreierTree" and it seems to make the 
    algorithm go faster by a factor 2.

<th valign="top">2004-06-24</th>
<td>
    The trick of using alternating actions at different levels of the 
    algorthim has now been implemented. Each base point in the initial partial 
    base is preceded by the one-dimensional subspace (ie the line) containing 
    it, and the projective action of the group is used on this line.

<th valign="top">2004-02-09</th>
<td>Implemented a more efficient version, using explicit levels and the trick
    of stripping Schreier generators. Code seems to be more than twice as fast.

<th valign="top">2004-01-17</th>
<td>A seemingly working version of Schreier-Sims has now been implemented. 
    It is the standard naive version without any optimisations.
