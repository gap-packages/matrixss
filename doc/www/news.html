    The trick of using alternating actions at different levels of the 
    algorthim has now been implemented. Each base point in the initial partial 
    base is preceded by the one-dimensional subspace (ie the line) containing 
    it, and the projective action of the group is used on this line.

<td>Implemented a more efficient version, using explicit levels and the trick
    of stripping Schreier generators. Code seems to be more than twice as fast.

<td>A seemingly working version of Schreier-Sims has now been implemented. 
    It is the standard naive version without any optimisations.
