<td>
    The Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm has been optimized and the 
    handling of relations has been fixed. Homomorphisms are now only used when 
    needed, and otherwise normal lists are used to map generator matrices to 
    each corresponding free group.

    The package is now also available as a Debian package, and is advertised on
    freshmeat.net

<td>
    The implementation of Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm seems to be
    working now. It is however still very slow, and there are possibly
    some mistakes in the handling of relations, since it appears that the coset
    enumeration never finishes successfully.

<td>
    Made an implementation of random element generation using the Rattle 
    algorithm by Leedham-Green, to avoid using GAP:s built-in algorithm 
    (which is Shake). This way some inverse matrix calculations are avoided.

    Also included is a not yet finished implementation of 
    Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm, which uses coset enumeration to 
    possibly decrease the number of Schreier generators that are considered at 
    each level of the standard Schreier-Sims algorithm.

<td valign="top">Development release</td>
<td>
    Implemented a simple (and yet slow) version of the random
    Schreier-Sims algorithm, as first described by Leon. The algorithm
    does not use any verification but takes as input a probability and
    tries to achieve at least this probability of correctness. However,
    since the group elements are probably not taken from a uniform
    distribution (it uses GAP:s PseudoRandom function) there is no
    theoretical guarantee of any probability.

    The stopping conditions used are simple: when a number of consecutive
    random elements sift to identity the algorithm terminates, and the
    number is calculated from the given probability. If lower and/or upper
    bounds on the group order are known, they are used in the algorithm.

<td>
Added more Options to control when some features of the algorthim
are used, sine it seems that, in particular, the tricks of extending
Schreier trees and using alternating actions do not always make things
go faster. Also incorporated some GAP-related improvements due to
Alexander Hulpke, and a selection of an initial store of base points
using a strategy of O'Brien and Murray.

<td valign="top">Development release</td>
<td>
    Added an Option to flatten the Schreier trees at creation time (make
    them have height 1), so that later only a single hash lookup is needed to
    find the orbit element for a given point.
    The Option is called "SimpleSchreierTree" and it seems to make the 
    algorithm go faster by a factor 2.

<td>The trick of using alternating actions at different levels of the algorthim 
has now been implemented. Each base point in the initial partial base is
preceded by the one-dimensional subspace (ie the line) containing it, and the
projective action of the group is used on this line.
