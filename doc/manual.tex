\Colophon{ This package was originally made as part of a student
project at the Department of Mathematics, Imperial College of Science,
Technology and Medicine in London, United Kingdom. It was made in
partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of
Science in Pure Mathematics.

I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Alexander Ivanov at
Imperial College and Dr. Leonard Soicher at Queen Mary, University of
London, for their encouragement and help.

I am also particularly grateful to Alexander Hulpke at Colorado
State University in Fort Collins, USA, for suggesting this project to
me, and for his constant help and advice during my work.
