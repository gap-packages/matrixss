\Colophon{
This package is made as part of a student project at the Department of
Mathematics, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in
London, United Kingdom. It is made in partial fulfillment of the
requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Pure Mathematics.

I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Alexander Anatolievich
Ivanov at Imperial College and Dr. Leonard H. Soicher at Queen Mary,
University of London, for their encouragement and help.

I am also particularly grateful to Alexander Hulpke at Colorado
State University in Fort Collins, USA, for suggesting this project to
me, and for his constant help and advice during my work.
