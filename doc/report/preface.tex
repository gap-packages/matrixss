This report is made as part of a student project at the Department of

I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Alexander Anatolievich
Ivanov at Imperial College and Dr. Leonard H. Soicher at Queen Mary,
University of London, for their encouragement and help.

I am also particularly grateful to Dr. Alexander Hulpke at Colorado
