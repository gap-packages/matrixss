To build the report, just run
make schreiersims.dvi
which runs bibtex and latex. If you want a Postscript, you can run
make schreiersims.ps
and if you want a PDF you can run
make schreiersims.pdf

If your system has an old version of (pdf)latex, then you may lack the
--recorder option, in which case make will fail. In this case, just
edit the Makefile and change the variable TEXFLAGS.
