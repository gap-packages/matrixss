To build the report, just run
make schreiersims.dvi
which runs bibtex and latex. If you want a Postscript, you can run
make schreiersims.ps
and if you want a PDF you can run
make schreiersims.pdf

If your system has an old version of (pdf)latex, then you may lack the
--recorder option, in which case make will fail. In this case, just
edit the Makefile and change the variable TEXFLAGS.

The document needs the LaTeX package algorithm2e which is available from CTAN,
http://www.ctan.org/
