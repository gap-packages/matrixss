Matrix Schreier-Sims short introduction
=======================================

When the package is loaded in GAP using "RequirePackage", a new
Attribute "StabChainMatrixGroup" is installed for finite matrix
groups, which contains a base and generating set, as well as the
Schreier trees for the orbits of the base points. The corresponding
Operation has two Methods. One is the standard deterministic
Schreier-Sims algorithm and the other one is the standard
probabilistic Schreier-Sims algorithm, possibly with verification
using Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm. The default is the
deterministic algorithm, and the probabilistic can be chosen by
passing an Option.

The package also installs a new Method for the "Size" Attribute for
finite matrix groups. The Method uses the above mentioned Attribute
"StabChainMatrixGroup" and computes the order of the group by
multiplying the sizes of the orbits of the base points.

The Option to define in order to select the probabilistic algorithm is
"Random". There are also a few more Options for the probabilistic
algorithm itself. If "Verify" is defined, the probabilistic algorithm
will execute Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm at the end, to
verify the probabilistic computation, so that a correct result is
guaranteed. For other options, see the manual.
