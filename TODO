Matrix Schreier-Sims TODO
=========================

- Implement a randomized algorithm, together with some verification step.
1) Implement Sim's Verify routine
2) Implement Seress heuristic algorithm that tests only one random Schreier 
   generator at each level for membership in the stabiliser. 
   Seress 4.5 (especially 4.5.1) and 2.3
   Use normal sifting (not speedup using base images).
   Use normal Schreier trees, not shallow trees as decribed by Seress.
3) Try to speed up heuristic by using shallow Schreier trees
   Seress 4.4, especially 4.4.2 and 4.4.3
4) Try to speed up by using base images instead of normal sifting
   Seress 5.2
