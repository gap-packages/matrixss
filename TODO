Matrix Schreier-Sims TODO
=========================

- Check for simple optimisations, remove unnecessary work.
- Rewrite algorithm in iterative form, using levels and use known facts about
  residue elements to choose drop-out level. This will remove recalculating of 
  some levels.
- Implement the well-known method of not regenerating Schreier generators.
- Try the trick from Hulpke involving other actions.
