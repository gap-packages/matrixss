Matrix Schreier-Sims NEWS
===========================
Important new features are listed here. 
More detailed changed are in the ChangeLog.

    Added an Option to flatten the Schreier trees at creation time (make
    them have height 1), so that later only a single hash lookup is needed to
    find the orbit element for a given point.
    The Option is called "SimpleSchreierTree" and it seems to make the 
    algorithm go faster by a factor 2.

    The trick of using alternating actions at different levels of the 
    algorthim has now been implemented. Each base point in the initial partial 
    base is preceded by the one-dimensional subspace (ie the line) containing 
    it, and the projective action of the group is used on this line.

    Implemented a more efficient version, using explicit levels and the trick
    of stripping Schreier generators. Code seems to be more than twice as fast.

2004-01-17
    A seemingly working version of Schreier-Sims has now been implemented. 
    It is the standard naive version without any optimisations.
