Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-07-30

A rudimentary manual has been created, and it is both included in the
package distribution and available from the package homepage. The code
is now more GAP-connected in the sense that the algorithms are methods
of an operation StabChainMatrixGroup and the package installs a method
for the Size attribute for finite matrix groups that uses that
attribute to compute the order of a group.
