Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-08-19

The so-called Verify routine by Sims has been implemented, from the
description in Seress book. This seems to be a better strong
generating test than the STCS algorithm, and one can now choose
between them with an Option when using the probabilistic
algorithm. The Verify algorithm is still neither cleaned up nor
optimised in any way, so it is not fast, but it appears to be both
sound and complete.

The probabilistic algorithm now again uses the GAP function
PseudoRandom to generate random group elements, since further testing
has indicated that this is the fastest method, even though we have to
calculate inverse matrices for the elements returned by this function.
