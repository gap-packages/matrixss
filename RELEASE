Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-06-24

The trick of using alternating actions at different levels of the algorthim 
has now been implemented. Each base point in the initial partial base is
preceded by the one-dimensional subspace (ie the line) containing it, and the
projective action of the group is used on this line.
