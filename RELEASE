Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-08-10

An algorithm highly inspired by the nearly linear time algorithm,
described in Seress book as well as in the 1991 paper by Babai et al,
has been implemented. Some parts of the nearly linear time algorithm
has not yet been implemented though, in particular the "short Schreier
trees". The implementation is still very slow, though, so the fastest
version is still the standard deterministic algorithm.

Other changes include the use of random subproducts in the
probabilistic algorithm, instead of random elements computed using the
Rattle algorithm. The representation of Schreier trees has been
somewhat augmented, to include the depth of each node, as well as the
height of the tree. There is a possibility to create shallow Schreier
trees, which are guaranteed to have at most logarithmic depth. These
changes are described in Seress book as well as in the above paper,
and are needed in the nearly linear time algorithm.
