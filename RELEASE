Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-07-03

Implemented a simple (and yet slow) version of the random
Schreier-Sims algorithm, as first described by Leon. The algorithm
does not use any verification but takes as input a probability and
tries to achieve at least this probability of correctness. However,
since the group elements are probably not taken from a uniform
distribution (it uses GAP:s PseudoRandom function) there is not
theoretical guarantee of any probability.

The stopping conditions used are simple: when a number of consecutive
random elements sifts to identity the algorithm terminates, and the
number is calculated from the given probability. If lower and/or upper
bounds on the group order are known, they are used in the algorithm.
