Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-07-08

The implementation of Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm seems to be
working now. It is however still very slow, and there are possibly
some mistakes in the handling of relations, since it appears that the coset
enumeration never finishes successfully.
