Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-07-07

Made an implementation of random element generation using the Rattle algorithm
by Leedham-Green, to avoid using GAP:s built-in algorithm (which is Shake). 
This way some inverse matrix calculations are avoided.

Also included is a not yet finished implementation of 
Schreier-Todd-Coxeter-Sims algorithm, which uses coset enumeration to possibly 
decrease the number of Schreier generators that are considered at each level 
of the standard Schreier-Sims algorithm.
