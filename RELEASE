Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-06-29

Added more Options to control when some features of the algorthim
are used, sine it seems that, in particular, the tricks of extending
Schreier trees and using alternating actions do not always make things
go faster. Also incorporated some GAP-related improvements due to
Alexander Hulpke, and a selection of an initial store of base points
using a strategy of O'Brien and Murray.
