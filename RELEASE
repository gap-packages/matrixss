Matrix Schreier-Sims Release Notes
==================================
Release date : 2004-06-26

Added an Option to flatten the Schreier trees at creation time (make
them have height 1), so that later only a single hash lookup is needed to
find the orbit element for a given point.
The Option is called "SimpleSchreierTree" and it seems to make the algorithm go faster by a factor 2.
